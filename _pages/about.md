As a mathematical physiologist, I am interested how the dynamics of biology produce robust physiological states and how perturbations to these dynamics result in diseased states. I use differential equations (ODEs, PDEs, SDEs) in combination with dynamical systems approaches (e.g., bifurcation analysis and multiple-timescale analysis) to build and analyze mathematical models of biological phenomenon, yielding mechanistic insight and therapeutic perspectives.

Previously, I completed my PhD in Physiology from McGill University, where I was advised by Anmar Khadra and primarily worked on problems related to cellular motility with a focus on focal adhesions and the biochemical signaling involved in their regulation.

I am also keenly interested in programming and software design. I love spending time thinking about how to best design my code so that it is both computationally efficient and pleasant to work with.
